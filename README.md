# Hide League Icons
A simple plugin that force hides the League-related icons such as Combat Masteries or Relics from the screen, independent of in-game Settings.

There is currently a vanilla bug that force enables the combat mastery relic icons in Raging Echoes Leagues upon login, which can get a little tedious to have to manually toggle off each time. This plugin is essentially a band-aid fix until the bug gets resolved.
